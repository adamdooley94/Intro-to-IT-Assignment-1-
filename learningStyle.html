  I completed the learning style questionnaire at <a href="https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/">howtostudy.com.</a> I am a visual learner, someone that learns best when information is presented in a written language format or in a similar visual format. <br>
   I learn and remember information as it is presented, meaning it should be clear, use symbols and highlight key ideas so that they stand out in my memory. These results are important to me as I can ensure that I maximise my learning by setting out notes in a visual manner that clearly represents the information that I need to learn.<br>
    It is also important as prospective employers often ask about how you learn and been able to identify and explain to them shows that you have really considered ways to be an efficient learner and that is a highly employable trait. <br>
With regards to working in team it is always important to remember that others may learn differently so information can be presented in a way that is useful to all members. This could be a presentation conducted by a team member with slides to reinforce key points, thereby allowing visual learners to see the information and allowing people who learn through listening to also be included.<br>
 When forming a team its vital to acknowledge that people learn in different ways and in order to maximise the team’s effectiveness, information and results should be presented in a variety of ways to cater for everyone’s needs.
