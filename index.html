<h1 style="color:white; ME</h1>

<p style="color:white;">  My name is Adam Dooley and I am a twenty-five-year-old living in Melbourneâ€™s west. My student number is s38083113 and email address is s38083113@student.rmit.edu.au.<br>
   I have always had a keen interest in IT and technology in general my entire life and spend my leisure time using a computer, playing video games or engaging in some other sort of tech activity like learning .<br>
to program or just to simply fiddle with tech. I hope to use this course to gain some more insight into the different aspects of the IT industry so that I can find my niche and potentially specialised in a field. <br>

I have worked with McDonalds for ten years and worked my way up to restaurant management where I was lucky enough to run a few different stores and really get a taste for leading a wide range of individuals and as a result I was able to grow and be confident in leading teams. <br>
 I have always sought the challenge of solving tech related issues in the workplace, be that a faulty device or software failure and ultimately been exposed to these sorts of things, combined with a lifelong interest of technology has driven me to pursue a career in IT. <br>
  RMIT was a sound choice for me as an institute to study with as I have lived in the Melbourne area my whole life and am familiar with the Uni and I feel that sense of familiarity is a great motivating tool to actually sit down and learn.<br>
