  <h1 style="color:white; ME</h1>

  <p style="color:white;">
  A project I would potentially like to work on in the future would be to create an all in one health tracking and assisting app. <br>
  There are plenty of these sorts of apps available, but I would like to create one that will contain important information for all things health related, such as tracking sleep, tracking vitals when exercising and it would need to include an incredibly simple way to track food intake.<br>
   I would like to make the journey of health improvement to be as simple as possible, giving users access to information that is current, accurate and relatable to them.
    </p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <h1 style="color:white" >Motivation</h1>




  <p style="color:white;"> In my own quest for improving my health and fitness I have found that the majority of apps that are available are made for an audience outside of in Australia, in that the dietary information is aimed at foods sold in other countries such as America and therefore it takes time to enter data about foods that were bought in Australia. <br>
     I would like to make an app for an Australian audience that has a database of general foods and brands sold in Australia which will make the information far more useful especially for those looking to start on the quest of improving health and diet.<br>
      This idea will remove the notion that its simply too difficult to find the information that’s required to improve health, fitness and nutrition.
    </p>
    <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <h1 style="color:white" >Description</h1>



  <p style="color:white;">  The app would initially be aimed at an Australian audience and contain information relevant to the user, such as if they are looking to join a gym nearby, the app would generate a list, if they are looking for walking trails or other forms of outdoor activities the app would find local and accessible options for them. <br>
     The app would also contain links to forums that users can post recipes or food ideas to share with the community. The app would provide the user clearer information on those foods such as dietary information, where they can purchase it in proximity to them and the cheapest price to purchase the item, an example of this being if it was on sale at certain supermarket. <br>
      I feel that there is a barrier for a lot of people when trying to prepare healthy foods or recipes that they can find the list of ingredients, but when they get to the supermarket, the names of brands and the varieties can become confusing and overwhelming and I would want the app to explicitly state what you need so that is clear and there is no guessing involved. <br>
       Some obstacles for creating an app such as this is keeping the information of where to purchase the right foods relevant and up to date. It may take collaboration from supermarkets so that information on specials and sales can be updated weekly as they change on a weekly basis. The app will also track sleep quality and give information and tips on your sleep cycle and how to improve it and become an efficient sleeper. <br>
        It will track vitals, such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and body temperature. Based on the data It collects it would suggest methods of exercise that would be beneficial to the user to achieve the health and fitness goals and be able to provide actual ways of achieving these goals.<br>
        <br>
          In summary the app would be able to analyse all your health goals, provide a means to achieve them, such as local foods that you could use or local walking trails or public sporting events that could all assist in achieving those goals and then the app will assist in tracking your progress in achieving these goals.
  <br>
  <br>

  <h1 style="color:white" >Tools & Technology</h1>



  <p style="color:white;">  This App would be designed for your mobile phone predominantly, be that android or apple users and this would be the way the user would interact with the app. It would also allow to be connected to more advanced health tracking devices, such as smart watches, heart rate trackers or a GPS tracker. <br>
     There would need to be a connection to online forums, where users can collaborate with others, adopt best practices and seek advice and motivation when required.<br>
      The aim is that Australians would feel they are supported and not alone in striving to achieve health and fitness goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1 style="color:white" >Skills Required</h1>



  <p style="color:white;">  Some skills that would required to bring this app to life, would firstly be to learn to program the software in a language readable by  mobile devices as a key factor of this app is that you can access it anywhere and upload data or get the information that you need. <br>
     The app would need to be flexible in the way its programmed as it would need to adapt to a variety of health monitoring devices such as smart watches, heart rate monitors and just different branded mobile phones that operate on different software.<br>
This may mean that a variety of versions will need to be designed so that the app could be supported by different kinds of mobile phones and by different health devices. <br>
Aside from the technical knowledge required to develop an application such as this, there would need to be some sort of intergration with Google so that users can get access to timely and accurate information <br>
that they need to achieve their goals. They may need directions, or just simply the capability to search for foods or facilities nearby.<br>
      The app will be highly accessible to users on any device as its designed to be convenient.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1 style="color:white" >Outcome</h1>



  <p style="color:white;">  If the app was completed and operated as intended, then it would be a one stop shop for all thing’s health. <br>
    <br>
     It would seamlessly track vitals, sleep pattern and quality, exercise activities and nutritional information. It will also provide recommendations on local facilities for exercise, which can be peer reviewed or recipes that users can upload.<br>
      it will provide information on exactly where to go to get the required food or ingredients. This means that it will suggest the nearby supermarket that has the food that you need on sale or if it’s a more specialised item for a specific diet, local users can leave comments regarding where to purchase the product. <br>
       In summary the purpose of this app is to break down the barriers that exist for people to live healthy and active lives, whether that be through providing information for exercise or clear and concise direction on food information that users may need to achieve their health goals.<br>
        Users will be able to discuss with other local users and get real and relatable advice that will assist them in their health journey.
