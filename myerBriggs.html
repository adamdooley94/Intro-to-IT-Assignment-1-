  I completed a Myer Briggs personality test on <a href="https://www.16personalities.com">16personalities.com</a> that showed that I am an INTP-T or Logician.  This a personality type that is know for brilliant theories and unrelenting logic. This personality type is someone that is enthusiastic open minded and straight forward. <br>
   However, at the same time they are someone that could appear to be insensitive, private and withdrawn and condescending. These traits are important to note In relation to team work as I am someone who may be enthusiastic about the task at hand and my have valuable ideas and information for the team.<br>
    But I may lack the confidence to share the ideas, due to second guessing my ideas or relevancy of points that I would like to bring forward. I am someone that can find it frustrating to convey ideas and explain how my thought process worked, and at times would rather just not give input than trying to offer a clear explanation.<br>
     This is crucial when working in teams as it is greatly beneficial in team work to share ideas and hear from different people as this is the basis of innovation. A logician can appear to be someone who is insensitive and this is something that they would need to be aware of when working in teams to ensure that they take other peoples feelings into account <br>
      when making decisions and generally being aware that not all decisions will be made purely based on logic.
  A logician will positively impact a team as they are imaginative and original people that seek creative ways to solve problems and are sound innovators. They are objective thinkers which ensures they will focus on solving the problem at hand and not stray too far from what is required.<br>
   They are people that are honest and straightforward and although in certain situations this could be a boundary for teamwork, it will also allow them to continue with progressing on tasks and keeping things simple.
