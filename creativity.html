<h1 style="color:white; ME</h1>

<p style="color:white;">
  I completed the creativity test at <a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com">test my creativity.com.</a> The test has listed me as someone that is less creative than that of the average person, however I feel that my creativity flourishes in some environments more so than others and it is affected by factors such as the current task at hand and my interest in the task.<br>
   An example of this could be that I have never been an artistic person and always struggled with tasks such as painting and drawing, but I enjoy writing and feel that I can generate some creative ideas when constructing a narrative.  <br>
It’s important for me to have this knowledge as I can be aware of my lack of creativity in some situations and it may be beneficial for me and the outcome of a project to seek assistance or advice when working on projects that require an aspect of creativity. <br>
 Its important to be aware of this when working in the team as others may thrive when a task demands creativity and for the benefit of the project they could focus on that aspect whereas I could focus on the parts that have a more explicit outline or scope. <br>
  When forming team’s creativity is crucial as you would preferably want a mix of individuals who are creative and think outside of the box and others that thrive when following structure and instructions. Having a mix would ensure that projects are creative and unique but at the same time will meet guidelines and perform that objective that is required.
