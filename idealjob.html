The Job advertisement I have chosen is a role as a senior full stack developer with Seek. I like the idea of being a full stack developer as it allows you to have creative input on all aspects of the creation or maintenance of an application.<br>
 You would have input on the design, data modelling and all aspects of creating an application. <br>
 A link to the advertisement -  <a href= "https://www.seek.com.au/job/39652644?searchrequesttoken=decc97e5-0672-4272-aaff-eba99f83d946&type=promoted">Full Stack Developer
  </a>
  </p>

<br>
<br>
<h1 style="color:white" >Skills, Qualifications and Experience Required</h1>




<p style="color:white;"> There are numerous skills and listed such as proficiency in working with React, C# experience. The current stack used by the business is Node and React therefore you would need to demonstrate competency in using those applications. <br>
   Some other requirements are to be proficient in domain drive design, Design Patterns and Data Modelling. You are required to be competent in coding in more than one language and being comfortable in crossing layer boundaries, meaning being able to produce a program that is coded across different applications. <br>
Another aspect of the job as it is a senior role is to mentor and coach others in writing testable and effective code. Having worked in the past as a leader in a workplace, I am passionate about developing the skills and knowledge of others and ultimately would like a role where I can continue to do this to some extent.

<br>
<h1 style="color:white" >How to Obtain Required Skills</h1>



<p style="color:white;">  There are many free learning materials on the web that will provide a good basis of knowledge for a role such as this senior developer. I could access websites such as Udemy or even watch YouTube Videos and learn the intricacies of applications such as Node and React. <br>
   This course and more so the entire Bachelor of Information Technology will give me great foundation knowledge into concepts such as domain driven design and data Modelling. There are accreditations that someone could take to demonstrate that they are profficient in using a language to code a <br>
   program and these sorts of things, and a portfolio of similar work would demonstrate the skills and knowledge required.
